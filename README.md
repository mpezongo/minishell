# Sumary :
Minishell is a small-scale command-line shell implementation written in C. It aims to provide a simplified interactive command-line interface for users to interact with their computer. This custom shell is designed to support a range of essential shell functionalities, including executing built-in commands and external programs, managing environment variables, and providing error handling for command execution.

## Key Features:

Built-in Commands: Minishell supports several built-in commands like env, export, pwd, cd, echo, unset, and exit, allowing users to perform common tasks within the shell environment.

External Command Execution: Users can run external programs and scripts by simply typing their names, mimicking the behavior of a traditional Unix-like shell.

Environment Variable Management: Minishell can manage environment variables, allowing users to set, update, and use environment variables in their commands.

Error Handling: The shell provides error handling for command execution, including displaying informative error messages when a command is not found or encounters an issue during execution.

Exit Code Tracking: Minishell tracks the exit code of executed commands and updates an environment variable accordingly, providing users with the ability to check the success or failure of previous commands.

## Purpose:

The Minishell project serves as an educational exercise and a practical introduction to shell scripting and command-line interface development. It offers a basic yet functional shell environment for users to practice and learn how command-line interfaces work, including parsing user input, executing commands, managing environment variables, and handling errors.

Usage:

Minishell can be used for simple command-line tasks and serves as a starting point for users interested in understanding and building more complex shell environments or command-line utilities.

## Note:

The Minishell project can be extended and customized to include additional features and functionalities to suit specific requirements and preferences. It provides a foundation for learning and experimenting with shell scripting and programming.
